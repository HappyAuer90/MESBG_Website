		"description": "Barriers encompass the likes of walls, hedges, barricades and other such terrain. Essentially, to count as defendable, a Barrier needs to be at least half the height of the attacker and the defender needs to be able to see over the Barrier.\n\nFor a model to defend a Barrier they must be in base contact with it. When this is the case, the defending model’s Control Zone will extend over the Barrier rather than stopping at it.. As with any other Control Zone, an enemy model cannot enter the defending model’s Control Zone without Charging them. To Charge a defending model, place the attacking model in base contact with the Barrier as close to the defender as possible.\n\nAdditionally, so long as a defending model has a Control Zone, enemy models cannot attempt to cross the Barrier within that Control Zone – they must Charge and fight them.\n\nIf the attacker is more than twice the size of the Barrier, then it will offer no protection for the defender and they may still ignore it as they Move.\n\nProne models may never defend a Barrier.\n\nCHARGING A MODEL BEHIND A BARRIER\n\nTo Charge a model that is defending a Barrier, simply Move the Charging model into base contact with the Barrier as close to the defending model as possible on the opposite side of the Barrier. Even though they are not in base contact, these models will still count as being Engaged in Combat and in base contact for all other purposes. The defending model’s Control Zone is then cancelled out.\n\nOnly a single model may Charge a model over a Barrier. However, models on the same side of the Barrier as the defender may still Charge them as normal.\n\nDUELLING OVER BARRIERS\n\nThe rules for making a Duel Roll over a Barrier are exactly the same as those for a normal Duel Roll.\n\nMAKING STRIKES OVER BARRIERS\n\nUnlike in other Combats, when models fight over a Barrier then Strikes are made before models Back Away. If the defender wins, then they may make Strikes as normal. However, if the attacker wins, then they must make an In The Way Test for each of their Strikes before rolling To Wound. For each Strike that fails its In The Way Test, nothing happens. For each Strike that passes its In The Way Test, a To Wound Roll is made.\n\nAs Backing Away happens after Strikes are made, models fighting over a Barrier will never count as Trapped if they couldn’t Back Away – unless the Combat has attackers on both sides.\n\nBACKING AWAY FROM BARRIERS\n\nIf the defender wins the Duel Roll and the attacker survives, the attacker Backs Away as normal.\n\nIf the defender loses but survives, then they do not Back Away; the attacker must Back Away instead.\n\nIf the defender is slain, then the attacker may immediately cross the Barrier and be placed where the defender was on the other side of the Barrier.\n\nATTACKED FROM BOTH SIDES\n\nShould a model defending a Barrier also be Charged by an enemy model on the same side of the Barrier as themselves, then they will lose all protection that Barrier would offer. As a result, the Combat is treated the same as any other Combat and all models will ignore the Barrier when making Strikes. If the defending model is slain, the attacking model may cross the Barrier as described above.\n\nIn an alternative situation, if the attacking model is Charged by another model on the defender’s side on the same side of the Barrier as the attacker, then this will also be treated as a normal Combat as described above – with the exception that even if the attacker slays the defender they may not cross the Barrier.",

Whilst when a Cavalry model fights it may combine the characteristics of both rider and Mount, it is always the rider that is considered to be fighting, and so will use any special rules or abilities, or apply any modifiers (such as fighting with a two-handed weapon) associated with the rider fighting in Combat.\n\nWhen a Cavalry model Charges, it gets two additional bonuses in the ensuing Fight Phase: Extra Attack and Knock to the Ground. To gain these bonuses, all of the following must be true:\n\n• The Cavalry model has Charged only Infantry models and, when the Combat is resolved, they are fighting exclusively against Infantry models.\n• The Cavalry model is not Engaged in Combat with another Cavalry model, a Chariot or a War Beast when the Combat is resolved.\n• The Cavalry model is not in any kind of Difficult Terrain.\n• The Cavalry model has not been Transfixed. These bonuses will still apply even if the Cavalry model is subsequently Charged by other enemy models, so long as all the above statements remain true.\n\nEXTRA ATTACK\n\nA Cavalry model benefitting from this bonus increases their Attacks characteristic by 1 for the duration of the Combat. So, a Cavalry model with 1 Attack would have 2 Attacks with this bonus, rolling two dice for the Duel Roll and making two Strikes. This bonus still applies if the rider is using the Attacks characteristic of their Mount.\n\nKNOCK TO THE GROUND\n\nIf a Cavalry model benefitting from this bonus wins the Duel Roll, then all Infantry models they are Engaged in Combat with will be knocked Prone after Backing Away – with the exception of Monster models or models with a Strength of 6 or above.\n\nMAKING STRIKES AGAINST CAVALRY MODELS\nIf a model wins a Duel Roll against a Cavalry model, then it may choose to make its Strikes against either the rider or the Mount. This choice is down to the player making the Strikes, and they can distribute them however they choose, and may even resolve them one at a time in the usual fashion, and even alternate between rider and Mount if they wish. No In The Way Tests are required to Strike either the rider or Mount. If the rider is slain, then the Mount becomes a Separated Mount. If the Mount is slain, then the rider will need to take a Thrown Rider Test; however, this is only taken and the effects applied after all other Strikes have been resolved.\n\nFIGHTING ACROSS BARRIERS\nCavalry models can defend Barriers in the same way as Infantry models. If a Cavalry model Charges a model that is defending a Barrier, then they do not get either the Extra Attack or Knock to the Ground bonuses. Remember though, that the Barrier must be at least half as tall as the attacker (in this case the Cavalry model) in order for it to count as a Barrier that can be defended.",

		"description": "A Cavalry model moves in the same way as an Infantry model, with the exception that it cannot take a Climb Test, Lie Down, Crawl or use the likes of ladders, ropes or similar. Cavalry models must also use the Move Value of the Mount when they Move.\nWhen comparing the height of the Cavalry model to an Obstacle or gap, use the height of the full model from the top of the rider’s head to the feet of the Mount. If the Cavalry model is in an unusual pose – such as rearing up or hunched down low – remember to use the model’s true height.\n\nMODELS THAT MUST CHARGE\nSome Cavalry models may have, or be affected by, a special rule that means they must Charge when they are Activated. When this is the case, if the only way for the model to Charge is for them to dismount, then they do not have to Charge as part of the special rule – they may Move as normal.\n\nCAVALRY AND DIFFICULT TERRAIN\nA Cavalry model that Moves whilst within Difficult Terrain counts the distance Moved as four times what it would normally be, rather than just two times as it would be for Infantry. So, a Cavalry model that Moves 1\" within Difficult Terrain will count the distance Moved as 4\". This penalty is applied the entire time a Cavalry model’s base is within Difficult Terrain. Additionally, whilst within Difficult Terrain, Cavalry models never get any of their usual combat bonuses for Charging, including the use of a lance if they carry one.\n\nJUMPING AND LEAPING\nCavalry models must take Jump and Leap Tests in the same way as other models. Jumping and Leaping from the back of a mount is not without risk, however. If a 1 is rolled for either a Jump or Leap Test for a Cavalry model, then in addition to applying the result rolled on the relevant chart, the model has also been Knocked Flying exactly as if they had rolled a 1 on the Thrown Rider Chart.\n\nDESCENDING\nA Cavalry model may Descend a distance equal to the height of the model without penalty. However, if a Cavalry model Descends a distance greater than this, then the Mount will suffer one Strength 3 hit, plus an additional Strength 3 hit for each additional 1\" it Descends greater than the height of the model.\n\nSTAIRS\nCavalry models can climb stairs, provided they are not too steep. Steps that are broad and shallow can be Moved over as normal, however, steps that are too steep cannot be Moved over by Cavalry models. If you are unsure whether or not a Cavalry model can climb a set of stairs, make sure you discuss this with your opponent before the game starts and decide whether or not those stairs are traversable by Cavalry models.\n\nDOORWAYS\nCavalry models cannot pass through Doorways or ceilings that are too low. See if the model will fit through the Doorway – of course, be reasonable here; as long as the Mount fits through, it’s safe to assume the rider is ducking down low in the saddle. As long as both players agree, the Cavalry model can Move through the Doorway.\n\nWATER FEATURES\nCavalry models can Swim, in fact they gain some bonuses when Moving through water features.\n\nCAVALRY AND COURAGE TESTS\nWhen you are required to take a Courage Test for a Cavalry model, only the rider needs to test. Cavalry models cannot use the Courage value of their Mount.",

In order to Charge an enemy model, a model must have Line of Sight to the enemy model at the start of its Move.\n\nTo Charge, measure the distance as you would for making a normal Move and, if the model’s Move Value provides it with enough movement to reach its target and get into base contact, Move the model into base contact with the enemy model. Once a model has Charged into base contact with an enemy model, they are both Engaged in Combat and the model’s Activation immediately ends.\n\nModels that are Engaged in Combat cannot be Activated during the Move Phase. However, should a model that was Engaged in Combat suddenly find themselves no longer Engaged before their turn to Activate has passed, then they may be Activated as normal.\n\nIt is quite possible, due to the order in which you Activate your models, that a model that could not make a Charge earlier in the phase might become able to as your Activation Phase continues. This makes the order in which you Activate your models extremely important. Models may end up blocking each other’s ability to Move, or may end up freeing each other to Move more effectively.\n\nCHARGES AND CONTROL ZONES\n\nThere are a few rules regarding Control Zones that are important to note when Charging:\n\nThe first is that if a model enters the Control Zone of an enemy model then they must Charge that model if they are able. The model may continue to Move within the enemy model’s Control Zone if they wish, if they still have some of their Move Value remaining, in order to Charge a different point of the model’s base; however, as soon as they come into base contact with the enemy model they must stop Moving. If a model enters multiple enemy models’ Control Zones simultaneously, then they may choose which of them to Charge.\n\nThe second rule is that a model that is Engaged in Combat immediately loses their Control Zone whilst they remain in Combat. This means you can eliminate the Control Zones of enemy models in order to clear a route through them.\n\nThe third rule is that once a Charging model enters a Control Zone, they may ignore the Control Zones of other enemy models in order to Charge their original target. This means that no matter how densely packed enemy models are, a model is always able to Charge the first enemy model whose Control Zone it Moved into.\n\nThe fourth rule is that a model that wishes to Charge an enemy model that has lost its Control Zone may ignore the Control Zones of other enemy models that it would be impossible for them to Charge. This only applies if they cannot Charge the model due to the placement of other models making the Charge impossible.\n\nCHARGING MULTIPLE ENEMIES\n\nModels may Charge multiple enemy models should they wish. To do this, the model must have a high enough Move Value in order to reach all of its intended targets and be able to Move into base contact with them all, at which point it will be Engaged in Combat with all enemy models it is in base contact with.\n\nRemember that after a model has entered the Control Zone of an enemy model it will ignore the Control Zones of other enemy models, and so is free to enter the Control Zones of any other enemy models as it completes its Charge against multiple enemies.",

If the Chariot comes into contact with other models when pivoting, simply move them out of the way by the shortest route to allow the Chariot to finish its pivot. If the Chariot comes into contact with terrain whilst pivoting, move the Chariot away just enough to finish its pivot.\n\nThe Chariot will then Chariot Charge up to its Move Value in a straight line. After each full 4\" of Move Value the Chariot has Moved, it may pivot again as described above before continuing its Chariot Charge.\n\nA Chariot ignores enemy Control Zones, and any model it comes into base contact with during its Chariot Charge (not whilst pivoting) will suffer a number of Impact Hits; the exact number and Strength of these Impact Hits will be stated in the Chariot model’s profile. Cavalry models suffer these Impact Hits on both the rider and Mount.\n\nIf the model is slain, the Chariot will continue with its Chariot Charge.

A Chariot affected by a Heroic March can still Chariot Charge as normal.\n\nA Chariot will halve its Move Value whilst within Difficult Terrain as normal, though may still Chariot Charge through it if needed. However, a Chariot that spends any of its Chariot Charge in Difficult Terrain must roll a D6; on a 1, the Chariot immediately suffers a Wound.

It is also important to note that for a model to attempt a Climb Test there must be some way for them to scale the surface, such as handholds, jutting rocks, wooden crosspieces, etc.\n\nTo make a Climb Test, the model Moves to the bottom of the surface they wish to Climb and rolls a D6, consulting the Climb Table to find out how successful the attempt has been. Cavalry models may not take Climb Tests.\n\nModels must Climb directly upwards, and the vertical distance a model Moves as part of a Climb Test is counted towards the distance a model can Move during their Activation. Climbing counts as Moving through Difficult Terrain.\n\nCLIMB TABLE\n\n1 Fall: The model Falls to the ground and becomes Prone at the bottom of the Obstacle they attempted to Climb. If the model was already at ground level, nothing else happens. However, if the model was higher than this then it will suffer Falling Damage. In either situation, the model’s Activation immediately ends.\n2-5 Success: The model successfully Climbs the Obstacle until it has reached its Move Value or reaches the top. If the model reaches the top, place it on top of the Obstacle in base contact with the edge. If the model is now within the Control Zone of an enemy model, it must Move the minimum distance required in order to Charge that model, so long as it doesn’t exceed its Move Value. Otherwise, the model’s Move immediately ends, even if within the Control Zone of an enemy model.

It may then continue its Activation as normal.\n\nCLIMBING TALL STRUCTURES\n\nIn rare circumstances, models may wish to Climb a taller structure that will take more than a single turn to reach the top. In these instances, either perch the model in a satisfactory way at roughly the right height or leave the model at the bottom of the Obstacle with a dice next to it to show how high up the structure it is.

What happens if the dismounted model has wargear that the mounted model didn’t have? For example, if a Mirkwood Elf Knight Dismounts, the dismounted models (Mirkwood Elf Warriors) all have options the Knight does not.\nA: In rare cases like this, the dismounted model gains wargear so it can be accurately represented by the model. In cases where multiple options are available, you must choose the option that sees the fewest pieces of wargear gained and choose the wargear that is the cheapest in points cost.\nFor example, in the case of the Mirkwood Elf Knight, it would Dismount and be represented by a Mirkwood Elf Warrior with a shield, as that is the option worth the fewest points – we presume the warrior found a discarded shield on the battlefield.

		"description": "A Siege Engine isn’t able to Shoot just in any direction, and needs to be facing its target in order to Shoot it. As a result, a Siege Engine has an Arc of Sight: this is a 45˚ angle that a Siege Engine can Shoot within. To determine if a model is in the Arc of Sight of a Siege Engine, place the Firing Arc Template over the centre of the Siege Engine with the middle line facing the same way as the Siege Engine. If a model is within this Firing Arc, then the Siege Engine has Arc of Sight to it.\n\nA Siege Engine cannot make a Shooting Attack if there is an enemy model in base contact with it.\n\nWhen making a Shooting Attack with a Siege Engine, start by picking a target model within the range of the Siege Engine, in Line of Sight from the Siege Engine and within its Arc of Sight. Many Siege Engine models have a minimum and maximum range (e.g., 12\"-60\") and as such they cannot choose a target that is closer than their minimum range or further than its maximum range. Every model can be described as either a Battlefield Target or a Siege Target, which will determine how easy it is to hit.\n\nOnce a target has been chosen, determine which crew members are firing the Siege Engine and then roll To Hit using the Shoot Value of the crew. If the crew members firing the Siege Engine have different Shoot Values, use the highest numerical value. So, if two crew were firing and one had a Shoot Value of a 3+, and one had a Shoot Value of a 4+, then you would use the Shoot Value of 4+ when rolling To Hit. If a Siege Engine was rotated in the preceding Move Phase, then it suffers a -1 penalty when rolling To Hit. If the To Hit Roll fails, the shot veers wildly off course and misses – nothing happens. If the target is a Siege Target and the To Hit Roll succeeds, the shot hits as normal. If the target is a Battlefield Target and the To Hit Roll succeeds, then the Siege Engine will need to roll on the Scatter Table to determine which model is actually hit by the shot. A shot can scatter onto a target that is out of the maximum range of the Siege Engine, or out of their Arc of Sight – this represents the shot veering or being blown off course.",

		"description": "Models that are heroes will have the Hero keyword, and have an important role to play in any battle. Hero models have a number of special abilities that distinguish them from the rank and file Warrior models that make up the bulk of any Army.\n\nMIGHT, WILL AND FATE\n\nThe most obvious difference between a Hero and a Warrior is that a Hero will have three additional characteristics: Might, Will and Fate. These characteristics do a great deal to separate a Hero from ordinary folk, and allow them to pull off extraordinary feats of heroism on the battlefield.\n\nUnlike other characteristics, Might, Will and Fate act as a finite resource, and once you spend these points your store of them is reduced – so use them wisely! Players will need to look for the most opportune moments to use their Might, Will and Fate Points during the course of a game, and will need to carefully keep track of how many each of their Hero models has spent so they know exactly how many more they have remaining. Once a Hero has spent all of their Might, Will or Fate Points they can spend no more, unless they are able to regain them in some way during the battle.\n\nIf a special rule allows a Hero to regain a Might, Will or Fate Point, this may not take that Hero above their starting number, unless specifically stated otherwise.\n\nIf a special rule allows for a Hero to do something that would usually cost a Might, Will or Fate Point without spending that Might, Will or Fate Point, then the Hero can still do this even if they have no Might, Will or Fate remaining – it is free.\n\nAll Hero models have an extra section to their characteristics that looks like this, which shows how many Might, Will and Fate Points they have at their disposal.\n\nHERO MOUNTS\n\nIn rare situations, a Mount may also have the Hero keyword and have its own store of Might, Will and Fate. When this is the case, both the rider and the Mount can use each other’s Might, Will and Fate interchangeably whilst the rider remains mounted. The only exception to this is that a rider cannot use the Will Points of their Mount to Cast a Magical Power. So, a rider could use their Might Points to improve a Resist Test made using Will Points from their Mount, a rider or Mount could use their Fate Points to prevent Wounds caused upon the other, and if targeted by a Magical Power the controlling player could choose to use a mixture of Will Points from both the Mount and the rider, though they should roll different coloured dice for each. When doing this, you should still mark down which of the two has actually spent the Might, Will or Fate Point.\n\nA Hero Mount with an Attacks characteristic of 0 will still automatically fail its Courage Test if it becomes a Separated Mount.",

		"description": "Each of the major phases of the game (Move, Shoot and Fight) have a Declare Heroic Actions step in them, and this is where players get the opportunity to declare the use of any Heroic Actions they wish their Hero models to perform. A Hero may only declare a single Heroic Action in each phase, though they can declare multiple Heroic Actions in the same turn provided they are in different phases.\n\nEach Heroic Action has the phase it can be declared in shown in brackets after its name. When a Hero declares a Heroic Action, the player states which Heroic Action is being declared and by which Hero; they then expend a Might Point and mark it down in some manner. A Hero cannot declare a Heroic Action if they have 0 Might Points remaining, unless they have a special rule that gives them a free Might Point, or a special rule that allows them to declare a free Heroic Action in certain situations. A Hero cannot declare a Heroic Action if they are not on the board.\n\nDuring the Declare Heroic Actions step of each phase, players take it in turn to declare a Heroic Action starting with the player without Priority. A player may choose to either declare a Heroic Action as above, or to ‘pass’; after which the player with Priority then does the same. This continues back and forth until both players pass in succession or are satisfied with the Heroic Actions they have declared – essentially it means that you always have the opportunity to declare a Heroic Action if your opponent does so. If a player decides to pass and their opponent then declares a Heroic Action, when the opportunity comes back to the player who passed, they do not have to pass again and can now decide to declare a Heroic Action if they wish.\n\nSome Heroic Actions (Heroic Move and Heroic Combat) interfere with the order in which a particular phase is conducted. For instance, a Hero who declared a Heroic Combat will resolve their Combat first. If two or more Hero models from the same side wish to perform such a Heroic Action, then their controlling player simply decides the order in which they are resolved. However, if Hero models from opposing sides wish to perform such Heroic Actions, then follow the system below to determine the order in which they are resolved:\n\n• Players nominate which Hero models are declaring Heroic Actions as described previously, and make a note that those Hero models have expended a Might Point.\n• The player with Priority rolls a D6. On a 1-3, the Evil player chooses one of their Hero models to perform the first Heroic Action. On a 4+, the Good player chooses one of their Hero models to perform the first Heroic Action.\n• The other player (the one who lost the roll-off) then chooses one of their Hero models to perform their Heroic Action. Note that as a result of the opposing Hero model’s Heroic Action, this may no longer be possible. In which case the Heroic Action is cancelled and the Might Point spent is lost.\n• Players alternate performing Heroic Actions in this manner until none are left.\n\nA model may only ever benefit from a single Heroic Action of each type during the course of a turn – a model could only benefit from one Heroic Move or Heroic March for example. The only exception to this is in the case of a Heroic Combat – a model that takes part in a successful Heroic Combat and then joins a second Combat, that is also a Heroic Combat, may still fight again as normal. However, in this situation, the model may not Move and fight again should the second Heroic Combat also be successful.\n\nUNIVERSAL HEROIC ACTIONS\nSome Heroic Actions can be used by any Hero in the game, regardless of who (or what) they are – so long as they have Might Points remaining, of course! Every Hero can use the following three Heroic Actions:\n\n• Heroic Move\n• Heroic Shoot\n• Heroic Combat\n\nSPECIALISED HEROIC ACTIONS\nSome Heroic Actions can only be declared by certain Hero models. In each Hero model’s profile there will be a section listing the additional Heroic Actions that Hero can declare.

The best way to do this is to get down to the ‘model’s eye view’ and see if you can see the target – this is the model’s Line of Sight. If, for whatever reason, you cannot get down to the model’s eye view, trace a 1mm straight line between the model’s head and its target using a tape measure instead. A model’s Line of Sight is worked out from the head of the model, and a model is always assumed to have a 360˚ Line of Sight.\n\nWhilst in reality our models are static, we imagine they are much more dynamic, swirling through the maelstrom of battle to slay their foes. Because of this we don’t penalise a model for the wargear they are carrying or a dynamic pose they happen to be in. As a result, a model only has Line of Sight to another model if it can see any part of the model’s head, body, arms or legs. If a model can only see the likes of banners, weapons, wings, tails or other wargear, then they do not have Line of Sight. A model always has Line of Sight to itself.\n\nSome models have terrain modelled onto the base. In these instances, the terrain is never considered to block Line of Sight to the model or to other models. If you are unsure whether a model has Line of Sight to a target, it is good practice to ask your opponent for their opinion and agree together – and don’t forget to play in a generous spirit! Should a player place their models on a taller base (or convert them so that they are lower down than the original model), this additional height is not taken into account when working out Line of Sight to or from the model – use their ‘true height’ instead.

They can use their Magical Power at any point during their Activation, after any abilities that must happen at the start of their Activation. This means that a model could Cast a Magical Power before their Move, after their Move, or even part way through their Move should they wish. A model that is Flying must land in order to Cast a Magical Power, and so cannot Cast a Magical Power whilst it is above other models.\n\nA model can use a Magical Power in the same turn in which it Charges, and even if it decides not to Move. If a model enters the Control Zone of an enemy model and then Casts a Magical Power that means they are no longer in that model’s Control Zone, then they are not obliged to Charge that model unless they then enter that model’s Control Zone during their remaining Move. A model that cannot Activate for whatever reason cannot then Cast Magical Powers that turn.\n\nWHO CAN YOU TARGET?\n\nMagical Powers come in three basic types: those that target a specific model, those that target all models within a given range, and those that don’t target any specific model. Who, or what, the Magical Power can target will be stated in the description of the Magical Power.\n\nA model can be the target of a Magical Power even if it is Engaged in Combat, unless the rules for the Magical Power state otherwise.\n\nWhen a Magical Power targets a Cavalry model, then it will target the whole model (and both parts will be affected) unless it specifically states that the caster must choose either the rider or the Mount to be the target. In these instances, the caster must declare if the rider or the Mount is the target before making the Casting Roll.\n\nGood models cannot Cast a Magical Power if by doing so they would risk wounding a friendly model.\n\nCHECK RANGE AND LINE OF SIGHT\n\nA model will need Line of Sight to the target in order to Cast a Magical Power upon them. The range of a Magical Power will be listed either in the model’s profile, or sometimes in the description for the Magical Power itself. If the range is listed as ‘self’ then the Magical Power must target the caster themselves.",

		"description": "A Hero model is able to spend a Might Point to adjust the score on a dice roll made on their behalf. For each Might Point spent in this manner, they may increase the result on one dice by 1. Might Points can only ever be spent to improve a dice roll, and cannot be used to reduce the score on the dice. It is also important to note that Might Points can never be used to increase the score on a dice above 6 – no matter how many Might Points the Hero has!\n\nA player does not need to decide to use any Might Points until all the dice have been rolled, any re-rolls have been used, and all other modifiers have been applied. Essentially, Might Points are always the last thing that can affect a dice roll. This is also true in the case of the likes of a Duel Roll where players are rolling against each other; Might Points are always the last thing to be used. This often means that a player can ensure the result they want if they have enough Might Points at their disposal.\n\nIf two opposing Hero models are fighting, both may use Might Points in order to try to win the Duel Roll. This is done as a bidding system, where the player whose Hero is currently losing the Duel Roll has the first opportunity to use Might. Should they choose to use Might to win, then their opponent then gets the opportunity to use Might as well. This goes back and forth until both players have used all the Might Points they wish to, or no more can be used.\n\nHero models can only ever use Might Points to alter their own dice rolls, and never to affect the rolls of their allies or enemies. This means in situations such as a Multiple Combat, it is important to roll the dice associated with a Hero separately or in a different colour so that all players know which dice can be modified by Might. A good system would be to have a different colour dice for each Hero in a Combat, and then another for Warrior models (as they don’t have Might to use). If you don’t have enough coloured dice to do this, then simply roll each Hero model’s dice separately and keep them apart from the others.\n\nCAN I USE MIGHT?\n\nMight can only be used in certain situations, and only to alter certain dice rolls. Here we have provided a list of what dice rolls Might Points can be used to alter, and some notes on how they take effect. It’s worth remembering that Might can only be used to alter the Hero model’s own rolls, and not those of allies or enemies. It also cannot be used to alter rolls made indirectly for the Hero, such as randomly determining an effect that impacts them, or during a roll-off to see which side wins a Duel Roll in the case of a tie.\n\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, Might Points cannot be used to alter any dice rolls other than the ones presented here. Where this is the case, it will be stated in the relevant special rule.\n•Taking Tests: Might can be used to improve the result of Jump, Climb, Leap, Swim, Thrown Rider and In The Way Tests.\n•Duel Rolls: Might can be used to improve a Hero model’s score during a Duel Roll. When used in this way, Might will be used after any modifiers and re-rolls have been applied.\n•Shooting: Might can be used to improve a To Hit Roll.\n•Wounding: Might can be used to improve a To Wound Roll caused directly by the Hero, such as with a Shooting Attack, a hit from a Magical Power, or when making Strikes. If a To Wound Roll requires two values, such as a 6+/4+, then any Might Points used on the first roll will also carry over to improve the second roll. Might cannot be used to improve a To Wound Roll caused indirectly by the Hero, such as an enemy model failing a Thrown Rider Test and suffering a hit, an enemy model hit by a model flung back by the Hero model’s special rules (such as a Brutal Power Attack or Magical Power), or an enemy model that was forced over the edge of a drop due to the Hero and suffering Falling Damage.\n•Courage: Might can be used to improve the result of a Courage Test.\n•Intelligence: Might can be used to improve the result of an Intelligence Test.\n•Using Will: Might can be used to improve the result of a Casting or Resist Test when using Will Points.\n•Using Fate: Might can be used to improve the result of a Fate Roll.\n\nSome Hero models will have special rules that will allow them to use Might Points to alter the dice roll associated to that special rule. Where this is the case it will state ‘Might can be used to alter this roll’.",

As such, a model that has Moved over half its Move Value during the preceding Move Phase cannot make a Shooting Attack. Additionally, a model that has attempted to Jump, Leap, Climb or Swim may not make Shooting Attacks that turn. Prone models may never make Shooting Attacks.\n\nA model that Moved during the preceding Move Phase, but did not Move more than half their Move Value, may still make a Shooting Attack, although it will be harder to do. To represent this, any model that wishes to Shoot after Moving during the preceding Move Phase will worsen their Shoot Value by 1 for the duration of the Shooting Attack. Therefore a model with a Shoot Value of 4+ that Moved will have a Shoot Value of 5+ for that turn. A roll of a natural 6 will always hit during a Shooting Attack.\n\nBear in mind that certain terrain has an impact on slowing models down further, as described in the Move Phase, and this is also applied to Moving and Shooting. For example, a model Moving within Difficult Terrain would only be able to Move a quarter of their Move Value and still Shoot that turn – halving it once for the Difficult Terrain, and then only being able to Move half of that value if they wish to Shoot.

To Move a model, measure how far it can travel and then move it along the desired distance within its Move Value, making sure to always measure from the same point on the base (you can’t measure from the front of a base to the back of a base, as then the front part of the base will have exceeded the model’s Move Value). Models are not required to Move in straight lines, and can Move in any direction they wish – you will often find yourself moving models around corners, Obstacles, other models and navigating complicated battlefields – though they may never Move more than their Move Value.\n\nModels may not Move through other models. If a model wants to Move in between two other models, or between a model and a piece of terrain, then there must be enough space for the base of the model to fit through.\n\nTerrain itself has a big impact on the game, with models constantly having to traverse many different types of battlefield. There may be some instances where a model will be faced with a piece of terrain that it could in theory fit through, however, its base will not fit – such as a Cavalry model Moving through a gate or a model Moving through a doorway that is slightly too narrow to squeeze its base through. In these instances, if it is obvious that a model would be able to Move through the gap, even if its base won’t allow it, then you and your opponent are free to agree this is possible – in fact, we would encourage you to do this. With this in mind, it is a good idea to have a chat with your opponent before the game starts to discuss any terrain features and make sure you are all agreed before the game begins.\n\nGenerally speaking, the facing of a model doesn’t matter (there are some  exceptions such as a War Beast or Chariot) since we imagine that our models are constantly fighting and looking around, rather than being static playing pieces. However, there may be times where you wish to rotate your models to give a more dramatic feel, such as having them face the target of their Shooting Attack or to face who they are fighting. This is fine to do, but should only be done to give that cinematic feel and not to rotate a model to gain an in-game advantage, such as avoiding being seen by an enemy model or causing an extra In The Way Roll.",

By the end of the Pairing Off Combats step, you will need to reach a situation where all models that were Engaged in Combat are assigned to a Combat, and that no Combat has multiple models from both sides involved in the Combat – i.e., you cannot have a Combat with two (or more) models from each side.\n\nWhen it comes to Pairing Off Combats, there are a few rules that govern how it works.\n\nThe first is that all models Engaged in Combat with an enemy model must be Paired Off into a Combat – they cannot be Paired Off in a way that would stop them being Engaged in Combat. Models can only be Paired Off into a Combat with a model they are in base contact with.\n\nSecondly, if a model could be Paired Off into multiple different Combats, then the player with Priority may decide which Combat the model is Paired Off into. These do not need to be done equally, so long as every model that was Engaged in Combat has been Paired Off into a Combat.\n\nIn practice, it is often a good idea for players to look over the Combats at the start of the Fight Phase and split them, with the player with Priority deciding on any where there are multiple options. It can be a good idea whilst you are learning to separate the Combats slightly so that there is a small gap between them. However, this should only be done for clarity and not to gain an advantage in-game by moving a model into or out of range of an ability. If models are moved in this way for the sake of clarity, they will still count as being in base contact with what they were with beforehand.\n\nSometimes there may be a situation where a rule will target or affect a model in a Combat which could cause multiple other models to be affected as well – such as a Shooting Attack, Magical Power or an ability that could Move a model out of Combat before the Fight Phase. When this would be the case, the game should be temporarily paused and the player with Priority should decide how the affected Combats should be Paired Off for the purpose of the rule or ability in question. Once this has been done, the rule is resolved as normal and play continues. When it gets to the Fight Phase, the player with Priority will then Pair Off the Combats again as normal.",

In a Multiple Combat, a Supporting model doesn’t have to Strike the same model as the model it is Supporting.\n\nModels that are Supporting do not count as being involved in the Combat they are Supporting. As a result, they cannot be targeted by Strikes, will not be knocked Prone by a Charging Cavalry model, cannot benefit from a Heroic Combat, and never count as being part of the Combat for the purpose of special rules or determining how many models are taking part on each side. A model can only gain Support from one spear-armed model at a time.\n\nA spear-armed model can only Support a single Combat during each Fight Phase. A spear-armed model cannot Support a Combat after already being Engaged in Combat. The only exception to this is that a spear-armed model that is involved in a successful Heroic Combat, and therefore gets to Move, may Move to Support a Combat, provided it hasn’t Supported another Combat that Fight Phase.\n\nA model can’t Support if it is Prone, rendered unable to Activate or has made a Shooting Attack during the same turn.\n\nA Hero that is Supporting may use Might Points to improve a Duel Roll or To Wound Rolls as normal. However, a Hero that has declared a Heroic Action in the Fight Phase cannot Support during that Fight Phase.",

Before you start a game, if there are any water features on the battlefield, you should discuss with your opponent whether they are classed as Shallow Water or Deep Water for the duration of the game.\n\nA model cannot choose to Lie Down in a water feature.\n\nSHALLOW WATER\n\nAreas of water that pose a minimal risk to those crossing them, such as streams, small ponds and fords, are classed as Shallow Water. Although these will slow models down, they are unlikely to do any harm to a model. Models treat Shallow Water as Difficult Terrain, with the exception of Cavalry, Monster and War Beast models who treat it as Open Ground.\n\nHowever, if any model begins its Activation Prone whilst within Shallow Water, then it must take a Swim Test as the first thing it does when it Activates. To make a Swim Test, the model rolls a D6 and consults the Swim Table. There are a number of modifiers that can affect a Swim Test, so make sure you check the list of them when taking a Swim Test.\n\nSWIM TABLE\n\n1 Sink: The model is overcome by the weight of its wargear (or its complete inability to swim) and drowns. Remove the model as a casualty.\n2-5 Swim: The model may Move up to half its remaining Move Value through the water.\n6 Swim Strongly: The model may Move all its remaining Move Value through the water.\n\nThe following circumstances will modify the result of a Swim Test. All modifiers are cumulative:\n• If the model is a Cavalry model, apply a +1 modifier.\n• If the model is equipped with heavy armour or heavy Dwarf armour, apply a -1 modifier.\n• If the model is carrying a shield (but not a light shield), apply a -1 modifier.\n• If the model is carrying a banner, apply a -1 modifier.\n\nDEEP WATER\n\nAny stretch of water that is deep enough that a model could not stand with its feet on the bottom without drowning is classed as Deep Water (Hobbits and Goblins probably find more areas of water deeper than others). Any model that enters an area of Deep Water must immediately take a Swim Test. Additionally, any model that begins its Activation within Deep Water must take a Swim Test as the first thing it does when it Activates.\n\nModels in Deep Water may not make Shooting Attacks. Models that are knocked Prone within Deep Water must immediately take another Swim Test and apply an additional -1 modifier.",

If the War Beast comes into contact with other models when pivoting, simply move them out of the way by the shortest route to allow the War Beast to finish its pivot. If the War Beast comes into contact with terrain whilst pivoting, move the War Beast away just enough to finish its pivot.\n\nAfter the War Beast has pivoted to face its desired direction, it will Move forwards the full distance of its Move Value in a straight line. A War Beast ignores enemy Control Zones, and any model it comes into base contact with whilst it Tramples (not whilst pivoting) will suffer a number of Impact Hits; the exact number and Strength of these Impact Hits will be stated in the War Beast model’s profile. Cavalry models suffer these Impact Hits on both the rider and Mount.\n\nIf the model is slain, the War Beast will continue with its Trample. If the model is not slain then the War Beast will stop and move into base contact with them, counting as Charging and be Engaged in Combat. A War Beast affected by a Heroic March can still Trample as normal.\n\nWhen a War Beast Tramples, it may cross any obstacles that are 2\" or smaller without penalty; though it cannot cross any Obstacles higher than this. A War Beast is unimpeded by Difficult Terrain or water features, and may Trample through them as normal; however, a War Beast cannot enter a piece of woodland terrain.

In these instances, a Good model armed with an Elven pike will win the roll-off on a 3+, whilst an Evil model armed with an Elven pike will win the roll-off on a 1-4. If both sides have an Elven weapon, neither side gains the benefit.\n\nPikes function in much the same way as spears, and allow models to Support in exactly the same way as those armed with a spear.\n\nAdditionally, a model armed with a Elven pike can Support another friendly model armed with a pike that is Supporting a friendly model Engaged in Combat – essentially giving two Supports to the same model.\n\nA pike requires two hands to use, and so a model armed with a pike will suffer a -1 penalty to their Duel Rolls if they are armed with a shield or a Missile Weapon.\n\nAs models armed with pikes can effectively Support at three models deep (one Engaged in Combat and two Supporting), it can be very easy to cause your own models to be Trapped, as only one model may Back Away not two. This is the risk of Supporting in such depth.\n\nAdditionally, if a Cavalry model Charges a model armed with a pike, then the model with a pike will gain a bonus of +1 To Wound when making Strikes against the Mount in the ensuing Combat.",

The Monster will then Hurl the nominated model.\n\nTo Hurl a model, follow the steps below:\n1. The Monster rolls a D3 and adds the difference in Strength between the Monster and the nominated model – this is the Hurl Distance.\n2. The Monster must then take an Intelligence Test (if the Monster is also a Mount, it may use the Intelligence of its rider if it is better).\n3. If the test is passed, the Monster chooses an enemy model it can draw Line of Sight to, and within the Hurl Distance from itself, to Hurl the nominated model at – this is the target. A model can only be chosen as the target of a Hurl once per turn. If the test was failed, the opposing player may choose one of their models in Line of Sight of the Monster, and within the Hurl Distance, to be the target instead.\n4. The hurled model suffers two Strength 6 hits (if it is a Cavalry model then both rider and Mount will suffer these hits), and if it was a Cavalry model then it is also Knocked Flying. If it is slain, skip the next step and move straight to step 6.\n5. If it survives, place it in base contact with the target model as close to the Monster as possible. If this is not possible, place the model in base contact with the target as close to the position it should have been in as possible. If there is nowhere to place the model in base contact with the target, move other models the minimum distance to make this possible. The Hurled model is then knocked Prone.\n6. The target model is then knocked Prone, if it has a Strength of 5 or less, and will suffer one Strength 6 hit (if it is a Cavalry model then both rider and Mount will suffer these hits). If it is a Cavalry model then it is also Knocked Flying.\n7. If there are no enemy models eligible to be the target, then the Monster may choose a point on the battlefield it can draw Line of Sight within the Hurl Distance instead. Place the Hurled model on the chosen point; it is then knocked Prone and suffers two Strength 6 hits.\n8.

These cannot be deployed in the enemy’s deployment zone, within 3\" of another Trap Marker or an Objective Marker, or within an enemy model’s Control Zone. When an enemy model Moves within 1\" of a Trap Marker, they immediately stop Moving and flip the Trap Marker; after resolving its effects, the model’s Activation immediately ends. Monster, War Beast, Swarm and Chariot models are completely unaffected by Trap Markers, and will instead simply remove them from play if they Move within 1\" of them. Once a Trap has been resolved and any affected models are no longer affected, remove that Trap Marker from play. The effects of each Trap Marker are explained below:\n\n• Tripwire Trap – When this is revealed, Baldo’s player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap suffers a Strength 2 hit and is placed Prone. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\n• Pitfall Trap – When this is revealed, Baldo’s player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap falls into the hole. Whilst in a hole, a model may not Move and always counts as Trapped. If a model begins its Move in a hole, they must roll a D6; on a 4+, the model clambers out of the hole and their Move immediately ends. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\n• Snare Trap – When this is revealed, Baldo’s player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap suffers a Strength 1 hit, is placed Prone and is now caught in the Snare Trap. A model caught in a Snare Trap cannot Activate and will always count as Trapped. During the End Phase, a model caught in a Snare Trap must roll a D6; if the roll is equal to or less than their Strength, then they are freed from the Snare Trap.

		"description": "During a game, there will likely be times where models will find themselves Prone. Whether this is as a result of a failed Climb Test, being on the receiving end of a Cavalry Charge or some other effect, it is important to understand how Prone models interact with the game.If a model is ever Knocked to the Ground, then they will immediately become Prone and a Prone Marker should be placed next to them as a reminder.\n\nCONTROL ZONES\n\nModels do not have a Control Zone whilst they are Prone.\n\nPRONE MODELS AND LINE OF SIGHT\n\nWhen a model is Prone, we imagine that it is writhing on the floor, cowering beneath a shield or scrabbling to try to regain its footing. Usually, another model would be able to see over a model that is Prone, though there may be some instances where this may not be the case (such as a Cave Troll being Prone). For these reasons, a Prone model is considered to be half its normal height (from the top of its head to its feet) for the purpose of working out Line of Sight.\n\nCRAWLING\n\nWhen a Prone model Moves it does so by Crawling, instead of Moving normally. A Crawling model may only Move up to 1\" regardless of the kind of terrain it is in, cannot make Jump, Leap or Climb Tests, and the only other thing it can do when it Moves is to Stand Up.\n\nProne models may not Charge – they must Stand Up first.\n\nSTANDING UP AND LYING DOWN\n\nDuring its Move, a Prone model may Stand Up at the cost of half its Move Value (so a model with a Move Value of 6\" would need to spend 3\" to Stand Up), and may then use its remaining Move Value to Move as normal, including Charging. A standing model may Lie Down also at the cost of half its Move Value. A model may not both Stand Up and Lie Down in the same Activation, and if it does either then it will still count as having Moved during their Activation.\n\nA Prone model may Stand Up whilst in the Control Zone of an enemy model without Charging them, so long as they Move no closer to that enemy model.\n\nCHARGING A PRONE MODEL\n\nProne models can be Charged as normal. As they have no Control Zone, enemy models can Move within 1\" of them without having to Charge them if they wish, provided they do not come into base contact with them. If they do, they will count as having Charged the Prone model.\n\nJUMPING OVER PRONE MODELS\n\nModels may attempt to Jump Over Prone models exactly as if they were an Obstacle, with the following exceptions:\n\n• A model that wishes to Jump Over an enemy model that is less than half its height must still take a Jump Test.\n• If a model attempts to Jump Over an enemy model and rolls a 1, they do not Jump Over the enemy model and instead must Charge them at the point in which they tried to Jump Over them.\n• If a model attempts to Jump Over an enemy model and rolls a 2-5, they will Jump Over the enemy model as normal and may choose to either Charge the model they Jumped Over after doing so, or instead be separated slightly from the enemy model and end their Move.\n• If a model attempts to Jump Over an enemy model and rolls a 6, they will Jump Over the enemy model and may continue their Move as normal.\n\nPRONE MODELS\n\nWhilst a Prone model cannot Charge an enemy, they can still be Charged as normal. A Prone model will still participate in a Duel Roll as normal, with one exception. If a Prone model wins a Duel Roll, they do not get to make Strikes against enemy models and instead may immediately Stand Up.\n\nA Prone model must still Back Away as normal, however, if a Prone model loses the Duel Roll they will always be considered to be Trapped.\n\nIf both models in a Combat happen to be Prone, the Duel Roll will still be made; however, the winner will simply get to Stand Up and the loser will Back Away as normal.",

		"descriptionGWFAQ": "Q: What rules are affected by Bofur’s Steadfast special rule?\nA: If a model is directly affected by a special rule, then they can attempt to ignore its effects via Steadfast. These can be special rules that directly target Bofur, such as the War Bat’s Pluck special rule. It can also be rules that indirectly target them, such as the bonus of +1 To Wound effect from a War Bat’s Piercing Talons or the ability for Azog To Wound on a natural 3+ via his I am the Master special rule.\nIt does not ignore rules that benefit an enemy model but don’t directly affect the model. For example, Steadfast cannot ignore a Hunter Orc Warriors’ Savage Hunters special rule, even if that model will be making Strikes against a model benefiting from Steadfast – only the Hunter Orc is affected, even if the end result is more dice rolled against your model! Similarly, rules such as The Three Trolls Kitchen Utensils cannot be ignored, as it is the Trolls that are re-rolling any dice of a natural 1. The Steadfast Roll is made when a special rule is triggered. For example, you would only test if Steadfast allows a model to ignore the Harbinger of Evil (X) rule when they take a Courage Test while within range. The benefits of Steadfast only apply for that test as well – the next Courage Test would require another Steadfast Roll.\nThe Steadfast rule does not negate a special rule – it simply means the model ignores its effect. So a War Bat would still make To Wound Rolls against the model, just without the +1 To Wound Roll if Steadfast applied, and the War Bat would get the bonuses against models not benefiting from Steadfast. Similarly, it only allows a model to ignore the parts of a rule that affect them, not the entire rule. For example, Steadfast will allow a model to attempt to ignore the part of the Pits of Dol Guldur Surprise Attack which stops models from declaring Heroic Moves. If the Steadfast Roll is successful, that model can declare Heroic Moves but it does not stop Azog’s controlling player from winning Priority; all other models you control must have each separately passed a Steadfast Roll to be able to declare Heroic moves.\nLastly, Steadfast does not apply to every rule – for example, it cannot be used against Strikes. If in doubt, look for a big header that says ‘Special Rules’ above the rule you are hoping to negate.",

As soon as they do they benefit from the Invisible special rule. A Ringbearer who is unable to Activate (such as if they are Engaged in Combat) cannot put on the Ring.\n\nIf a model puts on the Ring whilst they are mounted, then their Mount will immediately bolt and flee the battlefield (the Mount is therefore removed), and the model must immediately take a Thrown Rider Test.\n\n\nSAURON’S WILL\n\nIf a Ringbearer begins its Activation wearing the One Ring, then their controlling player must test to see if the model can overcome the call of the Ring. To do this, the Ringbearer’s controlling player rolls a D6 before doing anything else for the Ringbearer during their Activation. A Hero may use Might to improve this roll. On a 3+, the Ringbearer is able to keep control and may Activate as normal. However, on a 1-2 the opposing player may Move the Ringbearer during their Activation, and may even make them Charge – in this case, the model passes all Courage Tests for the Terror special rule.\n\nThe opposing player cannot make the Ringbearer remove the Ring when they Move them. The opposing player cannot make the Ringbearer pick up or put down items, perform anything that may bring the Ringbearer to harm (such as Jumping off a cliff or making a Leap Test), or make them leave the board in Scenarios that allow it.\n\nIt’s important to note that even when an opposing player gets to Move the Ringbearer in this manner, they are still part of their controlling player’s Army, and all other actions such as Shooting, fighting in Combat, or anything else the Ringbearer can do remains under the control of their controlling player.\n\n\nREMOVING THE RING\n\nSuch is the hold of the Ring, that any model who is wearing it and wants to remove it must take a Courage Test. This can be done at any point in the model’s Activation, though after making the roll for Sauron’s Will (if applicable). If the model this Courage Test then they cannot take the Ring off this turn and must wait until the following turn to try again.\n\n\nMY PRECIOUS!\n\nDuring a Matched Play game, if the Ringbearer is the only model left on their side and is Invisible (i.e., they are wearing the Ring), then they succumb to the call of the Ring and are removed as a casualty. If the opposing side’s objective is to kill the Ringbearer, then this is still achieved if the Ringbearer is removed in this manner.\n\nThere may be the odd occasions in Matched Play games where there is more than one model on the battlefield who can carry the One Ring. As the One Ring is Unique, there is a hierarchy as to who carries the One Ring in the case of multiple Ringbearers. The model closest to the top of the hierarchy table below will get to use the Ring – the other will not be a Ringbearer at all for that battle.\n\n1 The Dark Lord Sauron\n2 Isildur\n3 Bilbo Baggins or Bilbo Baggins, Master Burglar\n4 Frodo Baggins\n5 Bilbo Baggins, Ageing Hobbit\n6 Gollum\n\n\nIn the rare situation where both players have a Ringbearer, and both are at the same highest point on the hierarchy table, then both may carry the One Ring – though one of them is clearly a fake, and only the winner can claim that theirs was the real One Ring!",
